# GP-classification-for-maneuver-dection
The code uses Gaussian binary classification model to detect if the two tracks belong to the same orbit or not.

The Gaussian Process toolbox based on MATLAB is from "gpml_3.1" by Carl Edward Rasmussen & Hannes Nickisch and you can download it from: http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/
